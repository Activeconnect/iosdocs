# ActiveconnectiOS-Framework
[Activeconnect](https://activeconnect.io) is a system that enables authentication without using passwords.
An overview of the Activeconnect system can be found [here](https://activeconnect.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
Activeconnect uses a mobile application to collect data used to authenticate users.
There is a [default Activeconnect application](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/activeconnect-authenticator/id1140636912) available on the App Store.
This framework allows the functionality of Activeconnect Authenticator to be integrated into iOS apps and removes the requirement for customers to install an additional app.

The framework provides a default UI that can be used to process Authentication Requests but can be customized to match the appearance of other applications.

##Integration Guide
[This integration guide](https://activeconnect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios_framework.html) includes the information required to create an iOS app that processes Activeconnect Authentication Requests.
